Instances for OpenStack
=======================

This is a walk through for people using our clusters for OpenPower virtual
 machines.

Groups and Users
----------------
You need to first have a group which your user can live in.  If your
 organization doesn't already have group in OpenStack (on the cluster you
 desire, either x86 or OpenPower).  This group will have a quota for resources,
 image and flavor settings along with security settings.
Once we have made your group and user you will be sent a password that you
 should change.  Then you can login and proceed to the Instances section on the
 left side.
