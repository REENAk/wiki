User/Group Permissions
======================

Most permissions in Supercell are granted to groups rather than users, this way a group shares a quota, etc. and all users in a group will have access to that groups' virtual machines. It is our intention that each open source project using Supercell will have its own group rather than allocating things to individual users.

Group Admins
------------

Group admins have access to view group information such as users, VM permissions, and resource usage. Group Admins also have access to add/remove people to a group and the ability to grant group admin rights to other users.

If you are a group admin, you will have a 'Groups' navigation entry under an 'Admin' menu. To view/modify group information, click on the 'Groups' link, and then click on the name of the group you want to view.
