Quotas / Resource Limits
========================

Each group on Supercell has been granted a quota on CPUs, memory, and disk
space. Each VM owned by a group will count against your quota (even if it is not
running).

The default quota we assign to groups is: 2GB RAM, 40GB disk, 8 virtual CPUs. If
you need more than this amount, please send a request to support@osuosl.org
describing your needs. We will be as accommodating as we can, but ask you to
please don't use excessive resources unless absolutely needed -- this will help
us make Supercell available to as many projects as possible.
